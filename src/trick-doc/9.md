# Magic Trick No. 9

## Hint

ðŸ”® **Digit Dance** e.g. 9 Ã— 6 â†’ 6 - 1 = 5 (tens place), then 5 + 4 (ones place) = 54 (note: 5 + 4 = 9)

## Magic Rule

To multiply any single digit by 9, subtract 1 from the digit to get the tens place, and then find the ones place by calculating what needs to be added to the tens place to equal 9.

## Magic Story

In the Numeric Nightclub, the mysterious "Digit Dance" was performed by the graceful ballerina Nine. 

When paired with any single-digit dance partner, she'd perform her signature two-step routine. First, she'd take one step back from her partner (subtracting 1) â€“ if dancing with 6, she'd step back to position 5. Then, she'd extend her arm to position 4, ensuring that her position plus her arm's reach always totaled exactly 9 (5 + 4 = 9). Together, they'd form a perfect dance formation: 54! 

The nightclub's slogan became: "Step back once, reach for nine, that's how Nine makes digits shine!" Math students would imagine the elegant dancer whenever they needed to multiply by 9, watching her step back once and reach for a total of 9.
