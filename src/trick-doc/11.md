# Magic Trick No. 11

## Hint

🧑‍🍳 One Repeat, Two Sandwich e.g. 11 × 2 = 2 repeated = 22 OR 11 × 25 = 2(5+2)5 = 275

## Magic Rule

To quickly multiply a number by 11, there's a simple pattern: for single digits, just repeat the digit (e.g. 11 × 3 = 33, 11 × 6 = 66). For two-digit numbers, add the digits together and place the sum in between (e.g. 11 × 25 → 2 + 5 = 7, so insert 7 between 2 and 5 to get 275).

## Magic Story

In the whimsical land of Numberville, there lived two magical chefs: One Repeat and Two Sandwich.

One Repeat was a simple soul. Whenever a single-digit number walked into his bakery and said "11 please!", he'd say, "Double it up!" So if 2 came in, he'd hand over a warm, toasty 22. If 7 showed up, out came a delicious 77. Everyone loved how easy and tasty it was!

But Two Sandwich was a bit fancier. When two-digit numbers visited, she’d split the number into its two digits—like 2 and 5—mix them in her secret math blender (2 + 5 = 7), and stuff the sum right in the middle, like a sandwich! So for 25, you'd get a mouthwatering 275 mathwich!
