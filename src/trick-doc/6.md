# Magic Trick No. 6

## Hint

ðŸ§© **Three Twice** e.g. 6 Ã— 7 = 3 Ã— (2 Ã— 7) = 3 Ã— 14 = 42 **OR** 6 Ã— 7 = 2 Ã— (3 Ã— 7) = 2 Ã— 21 = 42

## Magic Rule

To multiply by 6, multiply by 3 first, then double the result. Alternatively, multiply by 2 first, then triple that result.

## Magic Story

The Calculation Kingdom had peculiar royal twins named Three and Two who worked together as "Three Twice."

Three could triple any number using her crystal wand, while Two could double numbers with his golden scepter. When they needed to multiply by 6, they had two possible routines. Either Three would go first (3 Ã— 7 = 21) and then Two would double it (21 Ã— 2 = 42), or Two would lead (2 Ã— 7 = 14) and Three would follow (14 Ã— 3 = 42). They'd perform this magical dance at festivals, showing that 6 was really just "3 then 2" or "2 then 3."

The kingdom's children would recite: "Three then Two or Two then Three, either way makes Six, you see!"
