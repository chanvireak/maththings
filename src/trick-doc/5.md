# Magic Trick No. 5

## Hint

🖐️ **Even Zero, Odd Five** e.g. 5 × 6 = 30 (even → ends in 0) **OR** 5 × 7 = 35 (odd → ends in 5)

## Magic Rule

When multiplying by 5, the result always ends in either 0 or 5. For even numbers, multiply the number by half and add a 0 at the end. For odd numbers, multiply the preceding even number by half and add a 5 at the end.

## Magic Story

In the magical town of Quintville lived two best friends: Even Zero and Odd Five, who ran the "Final Digit Bakery." Even Zero loved working with even numbers. When an even number like 6 came in, she'd cut it in half (6 ÷ 2 = 3) and add her signature "0" at the end, creating a perfect "30" pastry. Odd Five preferred odd numbers. When 7 arrived, he'd first make it even by subtracting 1 (7 - 1 = 6), cut that in half (6 ÷ 2 = 3), and then add his special "5" topping to create a delightful "35" treat. The bakery's sign read: "Even gets Zero, Odd gets Five, that's how multiples of Five come alive!" Children would remember the rule by wiggling their five fingers and saying: "Even numbers get a zero, odd numbers get a five!"
