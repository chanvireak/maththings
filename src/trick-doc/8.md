## Magic Story

In the Binary Billiards Club played three siblings known as the "Triple Triple" team. 

Their specialty was multiplying numbers by 8 through a precise sequence. First, they'd take any number (like 6) and double it to get 12. "Double once!" they'd shout. Then they'd double again to get 24: "Double twice!" Finally, they'd double one more time to reach 48: "Double thrice!" The audience would watch in amazement as the original number doubled three times to reach exactly eight times its value. 

The club's famous motto was: "Three doubles make an eight, no mistake!" Students would count "double, double, double" on their fingers when multiplying by 8.
