# Magic Trick No. 4

## Hint

ðŸŽ­ **Double Double** e.g. 4 Ã— 7 = 2 Ã— (2 Ã— 7) = 2 Ã— 14 = 28

## Magic Rule

To multiply any number by 4, simply double it twice. First double the original number, then double the result.

## Magic Story

In the Theater of Numbers performed the famous "Double Double" twins. They always acted in pairs, and each pair could magically duplicate any number. During their most popular act, they'd invite a number on stageâ€”let's say 7. The first pair would double it to 14, then bow and exit. The second pair would immediately double it again to 28, causing the audience to erupt in applause! Their catchphrase became mathematical legend: "Double once, double twice, four times the original in a trice!" Students who remembered the theatrical twins found multiplying by 4 as simple as applauding twice.
