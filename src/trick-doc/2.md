# Magic Trick No. 2

## Hint

ðŸ¦Š **Double Trouble** e.g. 2 Ã— 9 = 9 + 9 = 18

## Magic Rule

To multiply by 2, simply add the number to itself once, or shift the binary representation left by one place (which is equivalent to doubling).

## Magic Story

Twin foxes named Duo and Double lived on Addition Avenue.

They had a playful game they loved to show visitors. When any number came to visit, like the number 9, the foxes would make an exact copy of it. "Double time!" they'd shout in unison, as Duo would bring the original 9, and Double would bring another identical 9. Standing side by side, they'd form 18!

The townspeople called this "The Double Trouble Trick" because any number that visited would find itself standing next to an identical twin, creating a new number exactly twice as large.
