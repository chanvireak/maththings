# Magic Trick No. 1

## Hint

ðŸªž **Mirror Magic** e.g. 1 Ã— 7 = 7 (number remains unchanged)

## Magic Rule

Multiplying any number by 1 keeps the original number unchanged. It's the identity property of multiplication.

## Magic Story

In the enchanted Forest of Factors, there stood a magical mirror called "The One." Unlike ordinary mirrors that show reflections, this mirror had a peculiar powerâ€”anything that stepped before it remained perfectly unchanged. The villagers would marvel as apples, rocks, or even numbers like 7 or 42 passed through The One's frame and emerged exactly as they entered. The town mathematician explained: "The One never changes what it sees; it simply acknowledges your unique identity." That's why the wise old sage always said, "To know your true self, multiply by oneâ€”you'll remain exactly as you are."
