# Magic Trick No. 3

## Hint

ðŸ”º **Triple Triangle** e.g. 3 Ã— 8 = (2 Ã— 8) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24

## Magic Rule

To multiply by 3, double the number and then add the original number once more (2n + n).

## Magic Story

On Calculation Cliff lived three mountain climbers: Trey, Triad, and Trio.

They were known for their "Triple Triangle Technique." When presented with any number, like 8, they'd form a triangle. Trey and Triad would stand together holding the doubled value (16), while Trio would stand at the top with the original number (8).

When they joined forces at the summit, they'd have the triple value (24)! Their motto was: "Double first, then add once moreâ€”that's how we reach the triple score!" Hikers struggling with multiplying by 3 would remember the three climbers forming their triangle: double the number first (2 Ã— 8 = 16), then add the original once more (16 + 8 = 24).
