# Magic Trick No. 7

## Hint

ðŸŽ² **Lucky Seven Splits** e.g. 7 Ã— 8 = (5 Ã— 8) + (2 Ã— 8) = 40 + 16 = 56

## Magic Rule

To multiply by 7, split the number into (5 + 2) and calculate (5 Ã— n) + (2 Ã— n), which is the same as (n Ã— 5) + (n Ã— 2).

## Magic Story

In the Arithmetic Carnival worked the mysterious fortune teller, "Lucky Seven." Unlike other mystics, Seven always split herself into her two spirit guides: Five and Two. When a visitor like number 8 came for multiplication, Seven would disappear in a puff of smoke. Five would appear first, multiplying the visitor by 5 (8 Ã— 5 = 40). Then Two would emerge from the shadows to multiply the original visitor by 2 (8 Ã— 2 = 16). The carnival barker would then add these results together (40 + 16 = 56) to reveal the true product! The carnival's slogan became: "Seven splits to Five and Two, adds their work when they are through!" Math students would imagine the carnival tent whenever they needed to multiply by 7.
