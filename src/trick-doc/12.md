# Magic Trick No. 12

## Hint

üï∞Ô∏è **Doubling Dial** e.g. 12 √ó 7 = 84 (ones place: double 7 = 14, take 4; tens place: 7 + 1 = 8)

## Magic Rule

For multiplying by 12, follow this pattern: For the ones place, double the multiplier and take the last digit. For the tens place, it's the multiplier plus a simple adjustment: add 0 for multipliers 1-4, add 1 for multipliers 5-10, and add 2 for multipliers 11+.

## Magic Story

In the Clock Tower of Twelvetopia lived two magical clock hands: Doubler and Shifter.

When calculating 12 times any number, they worked in perfect harmony. Doubler, the hour hand, would always double the input number to determine the ones place‚Äîso for 7, he'd point to 14, keeping only the 4. Meanwhile, Shifter, the minute hand, used a special three-gear mechanism: First Gear (for inputs 1-4), Second Gear (inputs 5-10), and Third Gear (inputs 11+). For the number 7, Shifter would engage Second Gear, shifting the original number up by 1 to get 8 for the tens place. Together, they'd form 84!

The clockmaker's apprentices remembered this by saying: "Double for ones, shift up by gears‚ÄîFirst no shift, Second plus one, Third plus two‚Äîand the twelve times table appears!" Students imagining the magical clock would remember that multiplying by 12 meant doubling for the ones place and adding the appropriate shift for the tens place.
