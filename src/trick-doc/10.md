# Magic Trick No. 10

## Hint

✏️ **Zero Hero** e.g. 10 × 24 = 24 with 0 added = 240

## Magic Rule

To multiply any number by 10, simply add a zero to the end of it.

## Magic Story

In the Kingdom of Decimals lived a superhero called "Zero Hero" who had one special power—adding himself to the end of number lines. 

While other digits changed a number's value when they joined, Zero Hero would simply extend the line without changing the existing members. When the kingdom needed to multiply by 10, they'd call upon Zero Hero. If 24 citizens were lined up, Zero Hero would fly in and stand at the end, instantly creating 240!

His catchphrase was: "Make way for Zero Hero, adding one place is all you need-o!" Children would pretend to be Zero Hero, dramatically adding zeros to numbers whenever they multiplied by 10.
