# MathThings!

A simple and interactive web app to practice multiplication tables with dynamic questions, instant feedback, and helpful hints.

## What Is MathThings!

This project is a React + TypeScript application designed to help learners practice multiplication facts in a fun, engaging way. It generates a sequence of randomized multiplication questions based on selected tables and provides real-time feedback.

## Why It Was Made

MathThings! was created to:

- Reinforce multiplication skills through repetitive, yet varied questions
- Offer immediate feedback and visually engaging responses (confetti, audio)
- Provide hints for common mistakes by loading mini-guides dynamically

## Features

- **Randomized Questions**: Generate and shuffle combinations for selected times tables.
- **Instant Feedback**: Visual and audio cues for correct or incorrect answers.
- **Dynamic Hints**: Lazy-load hints from markdown files only when needed.
- **Practice Statistics**: Track progress and time elapsed.
- **Responsive UI**: Works across mobile and desktop with smooth layout transitions.
